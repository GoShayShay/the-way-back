    <p>
     <span style="color:orange;">Did you know that in the 80s icon Tina Turner <strong>shot at and grazed the scalp of Randy Jackson?</strong></span> That's right!</p>
      <p>According to the report, Tina was advising Bernadette on her relationship with Jackson.</p>  

<p><em>“Bernadette, let me tell you something, you’ve got yourself an Ike Turner, You better get rid of him. I know you’re scared. I know what it’s like, Bernadette. It’s best for you if you stay here tonight. Just make sure you get rid of that Randy Jackson first thing tomorrow.”</em></p>

<p>When Randy dropped by Turner’s home to try to convince Bernadette to leave with him, he became furious when no one would answer the door. He then allegedly hurled a flower-pot through the window — and that’s when all hell broke loose.</p>
